# Polly

Note: this application was discontinued, code is no longer maintained.

## Overview
This repository contains the server code for the Polly app on Android and iOS. Polly is an app that allows people to easily plan events with their friends using polls and date pickers.

## Notes on code style
In the not too distant future we intend to transition from our old code style as described on the wiki to the regular Go codestyle as described in [this document](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html). The current approach is to write new code in the old codestyle and update all code at once a later point in time. This is planned after the current issues list is dealt with sufficiently for an alpha release.
