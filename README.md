# Polly

## Overview
This repository contains the server code for the Polly app on Android and iOS. Polly is an app that allows people to easily plan events with their friends using polls and date pickers.

## Notes on code style
Currently we are in a transition phase between our old code style as described on the wiki and the regular Go codestyle as described in [this document](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html). The current approach is to write new code in the new codestyle, while we update the old code at a later point in time. The old code will be adopted to the new style after the issue list is finished for a beta release of Polly.
